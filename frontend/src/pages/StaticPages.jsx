        <p>
          ServiceMitra connects people in Bidar with verified local professionals - plumbers,
          electricians, carpenters, AC technicians and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding someone reliable for work at home usually means asking around and hoping. We
          built ServiceMitra so that it does not have to: every professional on the platform has had
          their identity and address checked before they can accept a single booking.
